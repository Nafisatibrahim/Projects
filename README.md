## Overview

Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction Project repository! This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on relevant medical measurements. Early detection of diabetes can lead to more effective healthcare interventions and improved patient outcomes.

## Dataset

We use the Pima diabetes, which includes various medical predictor variables and an outcome variable indicating whether a patient has diabetes (1 for "diabetes" and 0 for "no diabetes"). The dataset is available in the [dataset folder](/dataset).
The initital dataset contains 769 rows and 9 columns. Here is a description of the dataset:
- Pregnancies: To express the Number of pregnancies
- Glucose: To express the Glucose level in blood
- BloodPressure: To express the Blood pressure measurement
- SkinThickness: To express the thickness of the skin
- Insulin: To express the Insulin level in blood
- BMI: To express the Body mass index
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: To express the Diabetes percentage
- Age: To express the age
- Outcome: To express the final result 1 is Yes and 0 is No
